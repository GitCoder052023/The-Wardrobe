## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure principles. Upon receiving a security report, we will:
1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within 2 business days.
2. Begin investigating the issue and confirm its validity.
3. Provide an estimated timeline for a patch or mitigation.

We ask that security researchers:
- Refrain from publicly disclosing any details until we have released a fix.
- Avoid exploiting any vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system.

## Security Measures

The Wardrobe project includes several security measures to help protect user data:
- **HTTPS**: All traffic should be routed through HTTPS for secure communication.
- **Authentication**: We enforce secure password storage and provide JWT-based sessions for user logins.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data, including user passwords, is encrypted.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users have access to sensitive actions like account management and payment processing.
- **Regular Audits**: We periodically review code and dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

We encourage all contributors to follow these security best practices:
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the codebase.
- Review any third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- Run security tests before submitting a pull request.
- Use secure coding practices and avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

Thank you for helping to keep **The Wardrobe** secure!
